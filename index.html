    <div class="text-1">
        <p>We also know of another superstition of that time: that of <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-2"><span>the Man of the Book</span></a>. On some shelf in some hexagon (men reasoned) there must exist a book which is <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-1"><span>the formula and perfect compendium</span></a> of all the rest: some librarian has gone through it and he is analogous to a god. In the language of <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-7"><span>this zone vestiges of this remote functionary's cult still persist</span></a>. Many wandered in search of Him. For a century they have exhausted in vain the most varied areas. How could one locate the venerated and secret hexagon which housed Him? Someone proposed a regressive method: To locate book A, consult first book B which indicates A's position; to locate book B, consult first a book C, and so on to infinity... In adventures such as these, <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-3"><span>I have squandered and wasted my years</span></a>. It does not seem unlikely to me that there is a total book on some shelf of the universe ; I pray to the unknown gods that a man - just one, even though it were thousands of years ago! - may have examined and read it. If honor and wisdom and happiness are not for me, let them be for others. Let heaven exist, though my place be in hell. Let me be outraged and annihilated, but for one instant, in one being, <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-3"><span>let Your enormous Library be justified</span></a>. The impious maintain that nonsense is normal in the Library and that the reasonable (and even humble and pure coherence) is an almost miraculous exception. They speak (I know) of the <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-3"><span>"feverish Library whose chance volumes are constantly in danger of changing into others and affirm, negate and confuse everything like a delirious divinity."</span></a> These words, which not only denounce the disorder but exemplify it as well, notoriously prove <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-4"><span>their authors' abominable taste and desperate ignorance</span></a>. In truth, the Library includes all verbal structures, all variations permitted by the twenty-five orthographical symbols, but not a single example of absolute nonsense. It is useless to observe that the best volume of the many hexagons under my administration is entitled The Combed Thunderclap and another <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-3"><span>The Plaster Cramp</span></a> and another <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-5"><span>Axaxaxas mlo</span></a>. These phrases, at first glance incoherent, can no doubt be justified in a cryptographical or allegorical manner; such a justification is verbal and, ex hypothesi, already figures in the Library. I cannot combine some characters
        <br><br>
        dhcmrlchtdj 
        <br><br>
        which the divine Library has not foreseen and which in <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-2"><span>one of its secret tongues do not contain a terrible meaning</span></a>. No one can articulate a syllable which is not filled with tenderness and fear, which is not, in one of these languages, the powerful name of a god. To speak is to fall into tautology. <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-7"><span>This wordy and useless epistle</span></a> already exists in one of the thirty volumes of the five shelves of one of the innumerable hexagons - and its <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-7"><span>refutation</span></a> as well. (An n number of possible languages use the same vocabulary; in some of them, the symbol library allows the correct definition a ubiquitous and lasting system of hexagonal galleries, but library is bread or pyramid or anything else, and these seven words which define it have another value. <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-4"><span>You who read me, are You sure of understanding my language?)</span></a>
